# Scop

Scop is a small program that will show a 3D object conceived with a mod- elisation program like Blender. The 3D object is stored in a .obj file.
In a window, 3D object is displayed in perspective, rotate on itself around its main symmetrical axis. The object can be moved on three axis, in both directions.

Finally a texture can be applicable simply on the object and the same key allows to go back to the different colors.

### Tech
* Code written in C.
* Has a classic Makefile.
* Uses the MODERN OpenGL: version 4.0 minimum, with mandatory shaders.
* External libraries (other than OpenGL, libm and lib C) is used ONLY to manage the windows and the events.
